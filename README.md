# üçê Pear Code Editor
Pear Code is a web editor that makes it possible to write code in a real-time **collaboratively** fashion and to **execute** it right inside the browser.

You can find it up and running here: [www.pearcode.it](https://www.pearcode.it)

## Use cases
* Technical interview
* Pair programming
* Proof of concept
* Debugging
* Quick and easly shareable code snippets

## Pear Code Runner üèÉ

Pear Code editor can **execute** some languages and show theirs output straight in your browser!
This is made possible thanks to the related project [Pear Code runner](https://github.com/emanuelelongo/pearcode-runner) to which you can refer to know the exact list of supported languages.

## Next Steps
This is a rough reminder of what I'm going to (or try to) implement in the near future:

* initial code for boilerplated languages
* better security policy on firebase
* output should auto scroll down
* extends languages support
* code completion for C#
