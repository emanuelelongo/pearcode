# üçê Pear Code Editor
Pear Code is a web editor that make it possible to write code in a real-time **collaboratively** fashion and **execute** it right inside the browser.

You can find it up and running here: [www.pearcode.it](https://www.pearcode.it)

## Use cases
* Technical interview
* Pair programming
* Proof of concept
* Debugging
* Quick and easly shareable note

## Pear Code Runner

Pear Code editor can **execute** some languages and show its output straight in your browser!
This is made possible thanks to the related project [Pear Code runner](https://github.com/emanuelelongo/pearcode-runner)

## It's not only my own work
The capabilities of Pear Code are made possible by some great products like:

* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Firepad](https://firepad.io)
* [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/index.html)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


## Next Steps
This is a rough reminder of what I'm going to (or try to) implement in the near future:

* initial code for C#
* BUG: reload always set language to javascript 
* set security policy on firebase
* output should auto scroll down
* languages support:
    * node js (but keep js on browser alternative)
    * python
* code completion for C#
